NATIVE AMERICAN SPIRITUAL WISDOM
Collected Teachings from Various Tribes

Lakota Prayer
"Wakan Tanka, Great Spirit, hear me.
The two-leggeds, the four-leggeds, the winged ones,
and all that move upon Mother Earth,
are your children.
With all beings and all things we shall be as relatives."

Cherokee Teaching
"The Creator gave us the same earth, the same air, the same water.
We are all children of the Great Spirit.
We all belong to Mother Earth.
Our land, our water, our air are sacred.
Our responsibility is to take care of them."

Hopi Prophecy
"We are the ones we have been waiting for.
The time of the great turning has come.
We must transform our minds and hearts,
return to the sacred ways,
and heal our relationship with Mother Earth."

Iroquois Great Law
"In our every deliberation, we must consider
the impact of our decisions on the seventh generation.
Our responsibility is not only to ourselves
but to those children yet unborn."

Ojibwe Teaching
"Gichi-Manidoo created all things in love.
All beings are related - mitakuye oyasin.
The sacred pipe connects earth and sky,
the four directions hold us in balance."

Pueblo Wisdom
"We do not inherit the earth from our ancestors;
we borrow it from our children.
Every morning we must ask:
How can we live in right relationship today?"

Apache Prayer
"Now you must teach your children
that the ground beneath their feet
is the ashes of our grandfathers.
So that they will respect the land,
tell your children what we have taught our children,
that the earth is our mother."
