## üßæ OPENING PURPOSE LINE
"This file exposes manipulation, control myths, and occasional glimpses of divine clarity in a book often used to justify harsh tribalism. It is part of a full Bible dissection to uncover truth, strip away fear-based control, and rediscover what Yeshua truly taught: that the Kingdom of God is within us."

## DISSECTION METHODOLOGY

### STEP 1: AUTHENTICITY ANALYSIS
- Compare with earliest manuscripts (Greek/Hebrew/Aramaic)
- Identify later additions (Comma Johanneum, longer endings)
- Cross-reference with non-canonical preservation texts

### STEP 2: INSTITUTIONAL MANIPULATION IDENTIFICATION
- Track changes through Church councils (Nicaea, Trent, etc.)
- Analyze translation biases (Vulgate fear-amplification)
- Document control mechanisms introduced

### STEP 3: SPIRITUAL TRUTH EXTRACTION
- Identify core teachings aligned with Yeshua's message
- Reveal hidden meanings obscured by literalism
- Connect with universal spiritual principles

### STEP 4: HISTORICAL CONTEXT
- Show when/why manipulations occurred
- Identify political/institutional motivations
- Demonstrate pattern of control over truth

### STEP 5: PRACTICAL APPLICATION
- How authentic teachings empower individuals
- Why manipulated versions create dependency
- Path to direct spiritual connection
