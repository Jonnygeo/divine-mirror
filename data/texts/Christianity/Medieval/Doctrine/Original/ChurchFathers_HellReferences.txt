- Even Satan would eventually be saved
- Condemned at Council of Constantinople (553 CE)

HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT NOTES:
============================

1. Early Period (100-200 CE):
   - No unified doctrine of hell
   - Influence of Greek philosophy (especially Platonism)
   - Debate between literal and allegorical interpretation

2. Patristic Period (200-500 CE):
   - Augustine's systematic theology establishes eternal torment
   - Political alliance with Roman Empire influences doctrine
   - Rejection of universalist views (Origen condemned)

3. Medieval Consolidation (500-1500 CE):
   - Thomas Aquinas systematizes hell doctrine
   - Dante's Divine Comedy popularizes detailed hell imagery
   - Church councils formalize eternal punishment as dogma

TRANSLATION MANIPULATION NOTES:
==============================

Original Hebrew "Sheol" meanings:
- Grave, pit, place of the dead
- No concept of eternal torment
- Simply the place where all dead go

Greek "Hades" in New Testament:
- Also meaning grave/underworld
- Not originally place of eternal torment
- Borrowed from Greek mythology

"Gehenna" historical context:
- Valley of Hinnom outside Jerusalem
- Site of ancient child sacrifice
- Used metaphorically by Jesus for destruction
- Not clearly describing eternal conscious torment

The systematic development of eternal hell doctrine represents a significant departure from original Hebrew and early Christian concepts of death and afterlife.
