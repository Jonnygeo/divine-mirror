This version is derived from an ITRANS transcription which has been published at several different locations on the Internet. This version has some minor defects originating in the source files, which we hope to fix at some point. These files were posted in June 2004, and have not as of yet been vetted by any Sanskrit scholars. We welcome feedback about these files, see the site contact page. Also refer to the notes on the ITRANS source. IMPORTANT NOTE: To view the Sanskrit and Romanization of the Rig Veda, you need to set up your browser to view Unicode content. If you don't do this, you will see lots of boxes or question marks on these pages. This is not a problem with the site, it is a problem with your browser. For step by step instructions on how to set up your browser to view these pages properly, read the Unicode page.
