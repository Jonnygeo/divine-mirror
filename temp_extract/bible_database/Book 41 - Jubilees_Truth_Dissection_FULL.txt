📘 BOOK 41: JUBILEES — Truth Dissection

📜 This file exposes manipulation, control myths, and occasional glimpses of divine clarity in a book often used to justify harsh tribalism. It is part of a full Bible dissection to uncover truth, strip away fear-based control, and rediscover what Yeshua truly taught: that the Kingdom of God is within us.

📖 Jubilees 1:5-7
🔹 Text: Set your hearts on all the words which I shall speak to you... that you may walk rightly...
🏷️ Tags: ✅ Divine Origin
📝 Notes: Echoes true divine instruction — heart-based alignment, not fear-based obedience.

📖 Jubilees 4:17-25
🔹 Text: And Enoch was taken from amongst the children of men... and he was carried into the Garden of Eden...
🏷️ Tags: 🌀 Hidden Truth
📝 Notes: Confirms Enoch’s ascension and mystical knowledge — overlaps with 1 Enoch and lost spiritual insight.

📖 Jubilees 6:36-38
🔹 Text: For this reason it is ordained... to observe the sabbath in their dwellings...
🏷️ Tags: ⚠️ Human Manipulation
📝 Notes: Sabbath tied to strict calendar enforcement — signs of early institutional control embedding rituals.

📖 Jubilees 15:27-34
🔹 Text: And the Lord said... separate yourselves from the nations... for I am a jealous God...
🏷️ Tags: ❌ Distortion | ⚠️ Human Manipulation
📝 Notes: Harsh tribalistic tone — likely redacted post-Babylonian exile. Contradicts Yeshua's message of inclusion.

📖 Jubilees 23:26-30
🔹 Text: In those days children shall begin to study the laws... and many shall be consumed with sin...
🏷️ Tags: 🌀 Hidden Truth
📝 Notes: Dual insight — prophetic about future corruption, but laced with guilt-tripping morality language.
