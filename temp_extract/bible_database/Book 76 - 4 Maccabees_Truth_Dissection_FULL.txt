📘 BOOK 76: 4 MACCABEES — Truth Dissection

📜 This file exposes manipulation, control myths, and occasional glimpses of divine clarity in a book often used to justify harsh tribalism. It is part of a full Bible dissection to uncover truth, strip away fear-based control, and rediscover what Yeshua truly taught: that the Kingdom of God is within us.
