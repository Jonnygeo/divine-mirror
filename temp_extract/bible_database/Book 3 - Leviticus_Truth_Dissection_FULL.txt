📘 BOOK 3: LEVITICUS — Truth Dissection (Chapters 1–27)

📜 This file exposes manipulation, control myths, and occasional glimpses of divine clarity in a book often used to justify harsh tribalism. It is part of a full Bible dissection to uncover truth, strip away fear-based control, and rediscover what Yeshua truly taught: that the Kingdom of God is within us.

📘 BOOK 3: LEVITICUS — Truth Dissection (Chapters 1–27)

📖 Leviticus 1:1-9
🔹 Text: If any man of you bring an offering... he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering... and it shall be accepted for him...
🏷️ Tags: ⚠️ Human Manipulation | ❌ Corrupt Addition
📝 Notes: Animal blood ritual system begins. Later justified by priestly caste. Reinforces fear-based atonement, unlike Yeshua’s message of mercy and forgiveness.

📖 Leviticus 10:1-2
🔹 Text: Nadab and Abihu... offered strange fire... and there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them...
🏷️ Tags: ⚠️ Human Manipulation | 🌀 Hidden Truth
📝 Notes: Priestly control warning story. Possibly symbolic of unauthorized energy/spiritual misuse. Used to enforce strict obedience to ritual.

📖 Leviticus 11
🔹 Text: These are the beasts which ye shall eat... and those ye shall not eat...
🏷️ Tags: ⚠️ Human Manipulation
📝 Notes: Dietary law system for separation and control. May contain practical health truth, but later turned into religious bondage.

📖 Leviticus 16:2-34
🔹 Text: Day of Atonement... Aaron shall bring the bullock... and kill it for a sin offering...
🏷️ Tags: ⚠️ Human Manipulation | 🌀 Hidden Truth
📝 Notes: Yom Kippur roots. Ritual scapegoating echoes older Babylonian customs. Symbolic of inner purification but obscured by fear of wrath.

📖 Leviticus 18:22
🔹 Text: Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.
🏷️ Tags: ⚠️ Human Manipulation | ❌ Corrupt Addition
📝 Notes: Highly debated. May reflect cultural bias of priesthood. Weaponized to create moral hierarchy. Doesn’t reflect Yeshua’s direct teachings on love or grace.

📖 Leviticus 19:18
🔹 Text: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself...
🏷️ Tags: ✅ Divine Origin
📝 Notes: One of the only clear divine truths quoted by Yeshua Himself. A moral law rooted in compassion — not control.

📖 Leviticus 20:9-27
🔹 Text: Put to death... shall surely be put to death... their blood shall be upon them.
🏷️ Tags: ❌ Corrupt Addition
📝 Notes: Heavy execution-based legalism. Reinforces a fear state. Does not reflect the mercy, healing, and freedom Yeshua embodied.

📖 Leviticus 23
🔹 Text: These are the feasts of the LORD... Sabbath, Passover, Firstfruits, Atonement...
🏷️ Tags: 🌀 Hidden Truth
📝 Notes: Spiritual time cycles may reflect deeper divine rhythm. But bound to temple legalism in context. Later fulfilled and reframed by Yeshua.

📖 Leviticus 25:10
🔹 Text: Proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof...
🏷️ Tags: ✅ Divine Origin
📝 Notes: Jubilee concept = divine reset. Economic forgiveness and freedom built into cycles. Radical spiritual insight on debt and justice.

📖 Leviticus 27:1-34
🔹 Text: And the LORD spake unto Moses... concerning vows... estimation of persons...
🏷️ Tags: ⚠️ Human Manipulation
📝 Notes: People given monetary values based on age and gender. Dehumanizing element of legalistic system. Very priest-centric economics.
