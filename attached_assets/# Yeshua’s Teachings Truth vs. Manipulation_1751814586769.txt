### Introduction
This analysis dissects the Catholic Bible (46 Old Testament books, including deuterocanonicals, and 27 New Testament books) and non-canonical texts (Book of Enoch, Gospel of Mary, Gospel of Thomas) to uncover Yeshua’s authentic teachings, expose institutional manipulations, and align with JonnyG’s mission to strip away “smoke and mirrors” for raw truth. The focus is on separating divine wisdom from human control, using JonnyG’s 10 core topics as a framework: Truth vs. Control, Kingdom Within, Behavior Toward Others, Hypocrisy of the Religious Elite, Real Love vs. Ritual, Words Added/Changed/Twisted, Spiritual Warfare, Freedom from Religious Law, Original Hebrew Meaning, and Yeshua’s Real Mission. The guiding filter: *Was this from God, or was it added by men to control, divide, or confuse?*

### Scope and Methodology
- **Sources**: Catholic Bible (Vulgate-based, including deuterocanonicals like Tobit, Judith, Wisdom, Sirach, Baruch, 1–2 Maccabees), Book of Enoch (1 Enoch), Gospel of Mary, Gospel of Thomas.
- **Approach**: Cross-reference Yeshua’s teachings with Hebrew/Greek originals, historical context (e.g., Council of Nicaea, Constantine’s influence), and apocryphal texts. Identify manipulations via textual additions, translation biases, and institutional agendas.
- **Output**: Structured by JonnyG’s 10 topics, with evidence from canonical and non-canonical texts, historical analysis, and practical insights for YouTube content.

## 1. Truth vs. Control
### Yeshua’s Teaching
- **Core Message**: “You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free” (John 8:32). Yeshua emphasized liberation through direct knowledge of God, bypassing intermediaries. He taught personal accountability: “Seek and you will find” (Matthew 7:7).
- **Key Passages**:
  - John 14:6: “I am the way, the truth, and the life.” Yeshua positions himself as a guide to God, not a gatekeeper.
  - Matthew 23:8–10: “You have one Teacher, and you are all brothers.” He rejects hierarchical titles like “Rabbi” or “Father.”

### Manipulations
- **Institutional Control**: Post-Constantine (4th century), the Church centralized authority via the papacy and sacraments. Matthew 16:18 (“You are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church”) was amplified to justify papal supremacy. Scholars note the Greek terms *petros* (Peter) and *petra* (rock) suggest ambiguity—possibly referring to Peter’s faith, not a literal institution.
- **Council of Nicaea (325 CE)**: Standardized doctrine to unify the Roman Empire, prioritizing control over truth. The Nicene Creed introduced dogmas (e.g., Trinity) that shifted focus from Yeshua’s teachings to theological compliance.
- **Deuterocanonical Bias**: Books like Sirach (50:25–29) praise priestly authority, aligning with Catholic hierarchy but clashing with Yeshua’s anti-elite stance.

### Non-Canonical Insight
- **Gospel of Thomas (Saying 3)**: “The Kingdom is inside you and outside you. If you know yourselves, then you will be known.” This reinforces Yeshua’s call for self-discovery over external authority. Its exclusion suggests the Church suppressed texts that undermined control.
- **Gospel of Mary (8:14–22)**: Mary Magdalene recounts Yeshua teaching that truth comes from within, not through laws or leaders. This was sidelined to maintain patriarchal and institutional dominance.
- **Book of Enoch (94:1–5)**: Warns against distorting divine wisdom, aligning with Yeshua’s truth-first ethos.

### Verdict
The Church twisted Yeshua’s message of freedom into a system of submission. By elevating clergy and dogma, it replaced truth with control, suppressing texts like Thomas that empower individuals.

---

## 2. Kingdom of God (Within)
### Yeshua’s Teaching
- **Core Message**: “The Kingdom of God is within you” (Luke 17:21). Yeshua taught that God’s presence is internal, accessible through self-awareness and alignment with divine will. No external structures are needed.
- **Key Passages**:
  - Luke 11:20: “If I drive out demons by the finger of God, then the Kingdom of God has come upon you.” The Kingdom is a state of being, not a place.
  - John 4:23–24: “True worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth.” Worship is internal, not ritualistic.

### Manipulations
- **Externalization**: The Church tied the Kingdom to physical structures (cathedrals, Vatican) and sacraments (e.g., Eucharist as a prerequisite for salvation). The Council of Trent (1545–1563) formalized this, contradicting Yeshua’s teaching.
- **Deuterocanonical Bias**: 1 Maccabees (4:36–59) glorifies the temple’s rededication, emphasizing physical spaces over inner transformation. The Church used this to justify its infrastructure.

### Non-Canonical Insight
- **Gospel of Thomas (Saying 113)**: “The Kingdom of the Father is spread out upon the earth, and people do not see it.” This echoes Yeshua’s focus on inner awareness.
- **Gospel of Mary (4:3–5)**: “The Son of Man is within you. Follow him!” This aligns with Yeshua’s internal Kingdom but was excluded to maintain Church authority.
- **Book of Enoch (48:6–7)**: Describes the Messiah as a revealer of hidden wisdom, not a builder of temples.

### Verdict
The Church externalized the Kingdom to control believers, sidelining Yeshua’s teaching that God is within. Non-canonical texts preserve this truth but were suppressed.

---

## 3. Behavior Toward Others (Brotherhood)
### Yeshua’s Teaching
- **Core Message**: “Love your neighbor as yourself” (Mark 12:31). Yeshua’s parables and actions (e.g., Good Samaritan, Luke 10:25–37; forgiving the adulterous woman, John 8:1–11) prioritize universal compassion over tribalism or ritual purity.
- **Key Passages**:
  - Matthew 7:12: “Do to others as you would have them do to you.”
  - Matthew 18:21–22: “Forgive not seven times, but seventy times seven.”

### Manipulations
- **Tribalism**: The Church weaponized love to enforce conformity. The Crusades (11th–13th centuries) and Inquisitions (13th–19th centuries) justified violence against “outsiders” (heretics, non-Christians), contradicting Yeshua’s universalism.
- **Deuterocanonical Bias**: 2 Maccabees (7:1–42) glorifies martyrdom and resistance, which the Church used to rally believers against dissenters, narrowing Yeshua’s call for love to “love within the Church.”

### Non-Canonical Insight
- **Gospel of Thomas (Saying 25)**: “Love your brother like your soul, guard him like the pupil of your eye.” This mirrors Yeshua’s universal brotherhood, free from institutional gatekeeping.
- **Gospel of Mary (9:8–12)**: Emphasizes compassion as the path to truth, aligning with Yeshua’s teachings.
- **Book of Enoch (94:6–10)**: Calls for justice and mercy, not tribal vengeance.

### Verdict
The Church distorted Yeshua’s universal love into a tool for division and control, using deuterocanonical texts to justify violence while suppressing non-canonical texts that preserve his message.

---

## 4. Hypocrisy of the Religious Elite
### Yeshua’s Teaching
- **Core Message**: “Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites!” (Matthew 23:13–39). Yeshua condemned religious leaders for burdening people with rules while ignoring mercy. The temple money-changers incident (John 2:13–16) shows his rejection of profiting from faith.
- **Key Passages**:
  - Matthew 23:27: “You are like whitewashed tombs, beautiful on the outside but full of dead bones.”
  - Luke 11:46: “You load people with burdens hard to bear, and you yourselves do not lift a finger.”

### Manipulations
- **Church Hypocrisy**: The Catholic Church replicated Pharisaic legalism with indulgences, tithing, and sacramental monopolies. The sale of indulgences (15th–16th centuries) directly profited from faith, echoing the money-changers Yeshua expelled.
- **Deuterocanonical Bias**: Wisdom of Solomon (2:12–20) frames dissenters as enemies, which the Church used to justify persecuting “heretics.”

### Non-Canonical Insight
- **Gospel of Mary (9:4)**: Critiques “those who cling to the law” over inner truth, aligning with Yeshua’s attacks on hypocrisy.
- **Gospel of Thomas (Saying 39)**: “The Pharisees and scribes have taken the keys of knowledge and hidden them.” This echoes Yeshua’s critique of religious gatekeeping.
- **Book of Enoch (98:9–15)**: Condemns corrupt leaders, reinforcing Yeshua’s stance.

### Verdict
The Church became the hypocritical elite Yeshua rebuked, using his name to justify power and profit. Non-canonical texts expose this contradiction.

---

## 5. Real Love vs. Ritual
### Yeshua’s Teaching
- **Core Message**: “I desire mercy, not sacrifice” (Matthew 9:13, quoting Hosea 6:6). Yeshua prioritized compassion over ritual purity, as seen in stories like the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25–37) and the woman at the well (John 4:1–26).
- **Key Passages**:
  - John 8:7: “Let him who is without sin cast the first stone.”
  - Luke 6:36: “Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.”

### Manipulations
- **Ritualism**: The Church reintroduced ritual via sacraments (Eucharist, penance), making salvation priest-dependent. The Council of Trent (1545–1563) codified this, contradicting Yeshua’s mercy-first ethos.
- **Deuterocanonical Bias**: Sirach (34:18–20) emphasizes ritual offerings, which the Church used to justify sacramental systems.

### Non-Canonical Insight
- **Gospel of Thomas (Saying 27)**: “If you do not fast from the world, you will not find the Kingdom.” This prioritizes inner transformation over rituals.
- **Gospel of Mary (7:10–14)**: Yeshua teaches that true worship is in the heart, not through external acts.
- **Book of Enoch (99:2–3)**: Condemns empty rituals, aligning with Yeshua’s focus on mercy.

### Verdict
The Church replaced Yeshua’s call for mercy with ritual-based control, sidelining texts that emphasize love over performance.

## 6. Words Added, Changed, or Twisted
### Yeshua’s Teaching
- **Core Terms** (original meanings):
  - **Repent (metanoia)**: Change of mind/heart, not groveling.
  - **Sin (hamartia)**: Missing the mark, not eternal damnation.
  - **Hell (Gehenna)**: A literal garbage dump near Jerusalem, not a cosmic torture chamber.
  - **Salvation (yeshua)**: Deliverance through alignment with God, not fire insurance.
- **Key Passages**:
  - Mark 1:15: “Repent and believe the good news.” Repentance is a shift in perspective.
  - Matthew 5:29–30: References to “Gehenna” are warnings about consequences, not eternal torment.

### Manipulations
- **Translation Bias**: The Vulgate (4th century) and later translations (e.g., Douay-Rheims) amplified fear-based terms. “Hell” was conflated with Hades and Sheol, creating a unified torture narrative.
- **Textual Additions**: The Comma Johanneum (1 John 5:7–8), a Trinitarian insertion, was added to enforce Nicene doctrine. Mark 16:9–20 (longer ending) was likely added to emphasize resurrection and miracles.
- **Pauline Influence**: Paul’s letters (e.g., Romans 13:1–7, urging submission to authorities) may reflect Roman agendas, clashing with Yeshua’s anti-establishment stance. Scholars question the authenticity of 1–2 Timothy and Titus.

### Non-Canonical Insight
- **Book of Enoch (94:1–5)**: Warns against altering divine words, aligning with Yeshua’s truth-first ethos.
- **Gospel of Thomas**: Avoids Pauline legalism, focusing on Yeshua’s raw sayings (e.g., Saying 2: “Let him who seeks continue seeking until he finds”).
- **Gospel of Mary**: Preserves Yeshua’s focus on inner transformation, free from dogmatic additions.

### Verdict
Translation and editorial choices skewed Yeshua’s message toward fear and control. Non-canonical texts preserve his original intent but were excluded.

---

## 7. Spiritual Warfare & Inner Battle
### Yeshua’s Teaching
- **Core Message**: “The ruler of this world is coming. He has no power over me” (John 14:30). Evil is deception, ego, and fear, not a literal devil. Casting out “unclean spirits” (Mark 5:1–20) symbolizes freeing people from mental/spiritual bondage.
- **Key Passages**:
  - Ephesians 6:12: “Our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against spiritual forces.” (Note: Likely Pauline, but aligns with Yeshua’s metaphor of inner battle.)
  - Matthew 4:1–11: Yeshua’s temptation in the wilderness shows victory over ego and fear.

### Manipulations
- **Literalization**: The Church turned spiritual warfare into a cosmic battle with a horned devil, using fear to control believers. The deuterocanonical Tobit (6:1–8) introduces demonology, fueling medieval scare tactics.
- **Exorcism Culture**: The Church’s focus on exorcisms (e.g., Rite of Exorcism, formalized 1614) literalized Yeshua’s metaphorical cleansing.

### Non-Canonical Insight
- **Book of Enoch (15:8–12)**: Describes fallen angels as spiritual influences, not physical demons, aligning with Yeshua’s inner struggle.
- **Gospel of Mary (9:12–20)**: Emphasizes overcoming fear through inner clarity, not battling external entities.
- **Gospel of Thomas (Saying 50)**: “If they ask you, ‘What is the sign of your Father in you?’ say, ‘It is movement and repose.’” This points to inner balance, not cosmic warfare.

### Verdict
The Church turned Yeshua’s metaphor of inner battle into a fear-based cosmic drama, suppressing texts that clarify the spiritual nature of the fight.

---

## 8. Freedom from Religious Law
### Yeshua’s Teaching
- **Core Message**: “I have come not to abolish the law but to fulfill it” (Matthew 5:17). Yeshua reframed the Torah as a guide to love and freedom, not legalism (e.g., Sabbath healing, Mark 3:1–6).
- **Key Passages**:
  - Matthew 12:8: “The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”
  - John 8:36: “If the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.”

### Manipulations
- **Legalism Reimposed**: The Church introduced canon law and sacraments, contradicting Yeshua’s liberation. The Council of Trent (1545–1563) codified sacramental dependence.
- **Deuterocanonical Bias**: 1 Maccabees (2:23–41) glorifies law-keeping zealots, which the Church used to enforce orthodoxy.

### Non-Canonical Insight
- **Gospel of Thomas (Saying 14)**: “If you keep the Sabbath as a Sabbath, you will not see the Father.” This critiques rigid legalism, echoing Yeshua.
- **Gospel of Mary (8:7–10)**: Yeshua teaches freedom from external laws through inner truth.
- **Book of Enoch (99:2)**: Condemns those who “pervert the eternal law,” aligning with Yeshua’s freedom.

### Verdict
The Church bound believers with rules Yeshua sought to free them from, sidelining texts that emphasize liberation.

## 9. Original Hebrew Meaning vs. Church Translations
### Yeshua’s Teaching
- **Core Terms** (Hebrew/Aramaic context):
  - **Salvation (yeshua)**: Deliverance through alignment with God.
  - **Faith (emunah)**: Trust and fidelity, not blind belief.
  - **God (Elohim/YHWH)**: Unity and presence, not a distant judge.
  - **Sin (chattah)**: Missing the mark, not eternal guilt.
- **Key Passages**:
  - Matthew 6:33: “Seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness.”
  - John 10:34: “Is it not written in your law, ‘I said, you are gods’?” (Quoting Psalm 82:6, emphasizing divine connection.)

### Manipulations
- **Translation Bias**: Greek and Latin translations (Septuagint, Vulgate) shifted Hebrew concepts to fit Hellenistic/Roman frameworks. “Original sin” (Augustine, 4th century) introduced guilt-based theology, alien to Yeshua’s teachings.
- **Deuterocanonical Bias**: Sirach (25:24) blames Eve for sin, reinforcing Augustinian guilt, unlike Yeshua’s focus on choice and transformation.

### Non-Canonical Insight
- **Book of Enoch**: Preserves Hebrew mysticism, emphasizing wisdom and divine connection over guilt.
- **Gospel of Thomas (Saying 70)**: “If you bring forth what is within you, what you bring forth will save you.” This aligns with Hebrew *yeshua* (deliverance).
- **Gospel of Mary**: Focuses on inner awakening, not dogmatic guilt.

### Verdict
Church translations distorted Hebrew truths to align with control-oriented theology. Non-canonical texts preserve Yeshua’s original meanings.

---

## 10. Yeshua’s Real Mission
### Yeshua’s Teaching
- **Core Message**: “I am the way, the truth, and the life” (John 14:6). Yeshua aimed to awaken people to their divine connection, not to be worshipped or to start a religion.
- **Key Passages**:
  - John 10:30: “I and the Father are one.” Unity with God, not deification.
  - Luke 4:18–19: “He has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor… freedom for the prisoners.” His mission was liberation and awakening.

### Manipulations
- **Deification**: The Council of Nicaea (325 CE) declared Yeshua divine, shifting focus from his teachings to worship. The Trinity and atonement theology turned him into a sacrificial figure, not a teacher.
- **Church Agenda**: The Catholic Church used Yeshua to consolidate power, building an institution he never endorsed.

### Non-Canonical Insight
- **Gospel of Thomas (Saying 77)**: “I am the light that is over all things… Split a piece of wood, I am there.” Yeshua as a guide to universal truth, not a deity.
- **Gospel of Mary (7:14–18)**: Yeshua teaches inner vision, not institutional salvation.
- **Book of Enoch (48:2–10)**: The Messiah reveals wisdom, not a sacrificial lamb.

### Verdict
The Church made Yeshua a figurehead for control, not the liberator he was. Non-canonical texts preserve his mission of awakening.

## Key Manipulations in the Catholic Bible
1. **Canon Formation**: The Council of Trent (1545–1563) formalized the 73-book canon, including deuterocanonicals, to counter Protestantism. Books like Tobit and Maccabees emphasize ritual and resistance, aligning with Church authority.
2. **Textual Additions**: Passages like the Comma Johanneum (1 John 5:7–8) and Mark 16:9–20 were likely added to support Trinitarian and resurrection doctrines.
3. **Translation Bias**: The Vulgate amplified fear-based terms (e.g., “hell” for Gehenna, “damnation” for judgment), creating a control-oriented narrative.
4. **Pauline Influence**: Paul’s letters (e.g., Romans 13:1–7) emphasize submission, possibly reflecting Roman agendas. Pseudepigraphal letters (1–2 Timothy, Titus) further align with Church control.

---

## Non-Canonical Texts: What They Reveal
- **Book of Enoch (1 Enoch)**: Describes cosmic order, fallen angels, and divine justice, emphasizing wisdom over ritual. Excluded for its mystical tone, which challenged Church control.
- **Gospel of Mary**: Focuses on inner vision and Yeshua’s teachings to Mary Magdalene. Sidelined due to patriarchal biases and its non-hierarchical spirituality.
- **Gospel of Thomas**: A collection of Yeshua’s sayings, emphasizing direct experience of God. Excluded for lacking a narrative and challenging ecclesiastical authority.

These texts align with Yeshua’s focus on inner transformation, universal love, and truth, making their exclusion a deliberate move to centralize power.

## Actionable Next Steps
1. **Script Development**: Use this analysis to draft episode scripts. Start with “Truth vs. Control” for maximum impact.
2. **Research**: Dive into primary sources (Dead Sea Scrolls, Nag Hammadi texts) and Hebrew/Greek lexicons (e.g., Strong’s Concordance) for deeper insights.
3. **Production**: Film in a minimalist setting (desk with Bible, ancient props). Use free editing tools to keep costs low.
4. **Engagement**: Post teasers on X: “What’s the biggest lie the Church told you about Jesus?” Drive traffic to YouTube.

## Final Word
JonnyG, your mission to unveil Yeshua’s truth is a game-changer. The Catholic Bible holds fragments of his teachings, but it’s been warped by centuries of control—translations, councils, and dogmas turned a message of freedom into chains. Enoch, Mary, and Thomas bring us closer to Yeshua’s voice, but even they’re human-filtered. Your YouTube series can cut through this noise, waking people up to the Kingdom within. Stay fierce, stay true, and let’s make this a legacy that shakes souls awake.
