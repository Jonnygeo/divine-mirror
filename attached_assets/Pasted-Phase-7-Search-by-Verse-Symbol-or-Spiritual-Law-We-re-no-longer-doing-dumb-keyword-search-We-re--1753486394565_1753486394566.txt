Phase 7: Search by Verse, Symbol, or Spiritual Law
We’re no longer doing dumb keyword search. We’re building a spiritual forensics tool — capable of dissecting ancient texts by moral theme, symbol, concept, or verse reference across all traditions.

🧭 OBJECTIVE:
Add tag-based searching (symbols, archetypes, spiritual laws).

Allow verse-level search across all books.

Enable cross-tradition comparison filters (e.g., “karma vs grace,” “logos vs tao”).

🔑 STEP 1: Expand Metadata Schema
In your sacred texts directory (already structured like data/texts/[Tradition]/[Period]/[Type]), attach a .json metadata file per text or section:

Example: data/texts/Christianity/Ancient/Bible/KJV_Genesis/metadata.json
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "tags": ["creation", "duality", "fall", "divine law"],
  "symbols": ["serpent", "tree", "garden", "breath"],
  "themes": ["origin", "choice", "free will", "innocence"],
  "spiritual_laws": ["cause and effect", "temptation", "accountability"],
  "cross_links": {
    "Taoism": ["yin and yang", "wu wei"],
    "Hinduism": ["maya", "dharma"]
  },
  "key_verses": {
    "Genesis 1:1": "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.",
    "Genesis 3:6": "She took of the fruit, and ate..."
  }
}
You can build these metadata JSONs automatically later using AI if needed.

🔍 STEP 2: Implement Semantic Tag Search
Update your search backend to accept tag-based filters:

python
Copy
Edit
def search_by_tags(tags: list):
    results = []
    for doc in vectorstore.similarity_search_with_score(" ".join(tags)):
        if any(tag in doc.metadata['tags'] for tag in tags):
            results.append(doc)
    return results
📖 STEP 3: Enable Verse-Level Search
Let the user type something like:

Genesis 3:6

Your code can now parse that string and extract the exact line:

python
Copy
Edit
def find_verse(book: str, chapter: int, verse: int):
    # Load structured verse DB (could be SQLite or JSON)
    return verse_db[book][chapter][verse]
Also include aliases like:

"John 3:16" → match in all Bible versions

"Bhagavad Gita 2:47" → support for major Eastern texts

🔁 STEP 4: Cross-Tradition Symbolic Search
Let’s say a user types:

“Show me where the serpent appears in multiple traditions.”

You pull every metadata file with "serpent" under "symbols" and display snippets across traditions:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "Christianity": ["Genesis - Serpent tempts Eve"],
  "Hinduism": ["Nāga – divine serpent beings"],
  "Greek": ["Python of Delphi – slain by Apollo"]
}
This will let Divine Mirror reveal universal archetypes.

💡 Bonus Feature: “Spiritual Law Finder”
Let users search by a law, e.g.:

“Law of Sacrifice” → outputs:

Abraham offering Isaac (Judaism)

Christ crucifixion (Christianity)

Animal sacrifice in Vedas (Hinduism)

Letting go of attachment (Buddhism)

✅ OUTCOME:
Search like a mystic scholar: by symbol, theme, or law.

Discover hidden patterns between the Tao, Torah, and Trinity.

Pull verses like a digital concordance — anywhere, instantly.
