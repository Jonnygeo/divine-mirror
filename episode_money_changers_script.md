# Money Changers: Wealth vs Spiritual Poverty

## HOOK (0:00-0:30)
Yeshua's only violent act was against the money system. Churches today are the money changers.

## INTRODUCTION (0:30-1:30)
The man who lived in complete poverty and violently opposed the money system is now used to justify mega-church wealth and prosperity gospel. Today we examine this fundamental contradiction and trace how spiritual teachings became economic manipulation.
