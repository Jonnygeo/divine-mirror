# Divine Mirror AI - Project Documentation

## Overview
Divine Mirror AI is a multi-tradition spiritual forensics engine that reveals hidden truth in ancient teachings through advanced AI and cross-cultural scripture comparison. Where spiritual seekers meet source truth, this isn't just an oracle â€” it's a forensic intelligence system trained on over 160 sacred texts to expose distortion, reveal universal symbols, and awaken the inner Kingdom. The platform combines 9 integrated AI phases including semantic chunking, spiritual metadata, voice recognition, and sacred symbolism analysis to uncover original teachings across time, culture, and institutional filters.

## Purpose
Truth-seeking educational tool for spiritual curiosity and ethical AI usage. Exposes divergence between spiritual originators and modern institutions by comparing authentic ancient texts with modern interpretations, revealing propaganda, fear-based doctrine, and manipulation tactics. Not for monetization, not for financial use, makes no theological claims of authority.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI with OpenAI GPT-4o integration
- **Frontend**: Streamlit web interface  
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB for semantic text search
- **Text Processing**: LangChain for document loading and chunking
- **AI Model**: GPT-4o for intelligent analysis and comparison

## Project Architecture
- `backend/`: FastAPI server with document processing and LLM chains
- `frontend/`: Streamlit components for user interface
- `data/texts/`: Organized religious text corpus by tradition/period/type
- `app.py`: Main Streamlit application entry point

## Features
### Three Comparison Modes:
1. **Modern vs Original**: Compare original teachings with current interpretations
2. **Cross-Tradition**: Compare how different religions approach the same concepts  
3. **Timeline Evolution**: Track how teachings changed across historical periods

### Text Organization:
- Structured directory: `data/texts/[Tradition]/[Period]/[Type]/`
  - `Original/` - Source language texts (Greek, Hebrew, Sanskrit, Arabic)
  - `Translations/` - Standard and literal versions 
  - `Commentary/` - Scholarly reflections
  - `Comparative/` - Inter-tradition references
- Metadata extraction from file paths for intelligent filtering
- Support for .txt, .pdf, and .json formats
