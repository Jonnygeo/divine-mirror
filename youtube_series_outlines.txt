# "Unveiling Yeshua: The Truth Behind the Bible" - YouTube Series Outlines
## Based on JonnyG's Truth Dissection Framework

### EPISODE 1: "Truth vs. Control - How the Church Hijacked Jesus's Message"
**Hook**: "What if I told you Jesus never founded the Catholic Church?"
**Key Points**:
- Yeshua taught "You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free" (John 8:32)
- He rejected hierarchical titles: "You have one Teacher, and you are all brothers" (Matthew 23:8-10)
- Post-Constantine manipulation: Council of Nicaea (325 CE) prioritized control over truth
- Papal supremacy vs. Yeshua's anti-establishment message
- Gospel of Thomas suppression: "The Kingdom is inside you and outside you"
**Script Hook**: "The man who said 'call no man father' somehow became the foundation for calling the Pope 'Holy Father.' Let's expose this contradiction."

### EPISODE 2: "The Kingdom Within - Jesus's Lost Teaching About Inner Power"
**Hook**: "Churches don't want you to know this one verse that destroys their authority"
**Key Points**:
- Luke 17:21: "The Kingdom of God is within you" - original Greek analysis
- No external structures needed for divine connection
- Church externalization through cathedrals, Vatican, sacraments
- Council of Trent (1545-1563) formalized institutional dependency
- Gospel of Mary: "The Son of Man is within you. Follow him!"
**Script Hook**: "If God's Kingdom is within you, why do you need a priest, a building, or a tithe to access it?"

### EPISODE 3: "Love vs. Ritual - How the Church Replaced Mercy with Control"
**Hook**: "Jesus said 'I desire mercy, not sacrifice' - but churches still demand both"
**Key Points**:
- Matthew 9:13: Mercy over ritual performance
- Universal love: "Love your neighbor as yourself" (Mark 12:31)
- Church reintroduction of ritualism through sacraments
- Making salvation priest-dependent vs. Yeshua's direct mercy
- Stories: Woman at the well, adulterous woman - mercy without ritual
**Script Hook**: "The same Jesus who said 'your sins are forgiven' without confession booths somehow needs 7 sacraments administered by celibate priests?"

### EPISODE 4: "Religious Hypocrisy - Jesus vs. the Church Elite"
**Hook**: "Jesus called religious leaders 'whitewashed tombs' - would he say the same about modern churches?"
**Key Points**:
- Matthew 23:13-39: "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites!"
- Temple money-changers (John 2:13-16) vs. modern church wealth
- Sale of indulgences paralleling money-changers Jesus expelled
- Vatican wealth vs. Jesus's simple lifestyle
- Gospel of Thomas: "The Pharisees and scribes have taken the keys of knowledge and hidden them"
**Script Hook**: "Jesus threw out money-changers. The Vatican has its own bank. See the problem?"

### EPISODE 5: "Biblical Manipulation - Words Changed to Control You"
**Hook**: "What if 'hell' was just a garbage dump and 'repent' didn't mean grovel?"
**Key Points**:
- Gehenna = literal garbage dump near Jerusalem, not cosmic torture
- Metanoia = change of mind/heart, not groveling submission
- Hamartia = missing the mark, not eternal damnation
- Vulgate translation biases amplifying fear
- Textual additions: Comma Johanneum, Mark 16:9-20
**Script Hook**: "They turned a trash dump into eternal torture and called it 'biblical truth.'"

### EPISODE 6: "Spiritual Warfare - The Real Battle Is Within"
**Hook**: "Jesus faced temptation in the wilderness - not a red devil with horns"
**Key Points**:
- John 14:30: "The ruler of this world has no power over me"
- Spiritual forces = ego, fear, deception, not literal demons
- Matthew 4:1-11: Temptation as inner battle over external power
- Church literalization to create fear and dependency
- Book of Enoch: Fallen angels as metaphor for corrupted knowledge
**Script Hook**: "The devil isn't coming for you with pitchforks - he's already in your fear-based beliefs."

### EPISODE 7: "Fear vs. Love - How Churches Weaponized Salvation"
**Hook**: "Perfect love casts out fear - so why are churches built on fear?"
**Key Points**:
- 1 John 4:18: "Perfect love drives out fear"
- Yeshua's message of love, acceptance, forgiveness
- Church introduction of fear-based salvation (hell doctrine)
- Fire insurance vs. spiritual transformation
- Gospel of Mary: Love as the path to truth
**Script Hook**: "If God is love, why does the Church need to threaten you with hell to get you to love Him back?"

### EPISODE 8: "Prophecy Manipulation - End Times as Control Tool"
**Hook**: "Every generation thinks it's the last - that's the point"
**Key Points**:
- Revelation as symbolic resistance literature, not literal prediction
- Church use of end-times fear for urgency and control
- Mark 13:32: "No one knows the day or hour"
- Historical failed predictions maintaining dependency
- Book of Enoch: Prophecy as pattern recognition, not fortune telling
**Script Hook**: "They've been selling 'end times' for 2,000 years. It's the ultimate subscription service."

### EPISODE 9: "Suppressed Gospels - What They Don't Want You to Read"
**Hook**: "Why did the Church ban books that made people feel empowered?"
**Key Points**:
- Gospel of Thomas: Inner Kingdom teachings
- Gospel of Mary: Women's spiritual authority
- Book of Enoch: Direct divine knowledge
- Council decisions based on power, not truth
- What these texts reveal about authentic spirituality
**Script Hook**: "If these gospels were lies, why burn them? Truth doesn't fear investigation."

**Key Points**:
